    "The AMD Ryzen 9 9950X processor will be the new consumer flagship part, featuring 16 CPU cores and a speedy 5.7 GHz maximum boost frequency.",
    "The other SKUs include, 6, 8, and 12 core parts, giving users a varied combination of core and thread counts.",
    "All four of these initial chips will be X-series chips, meaning they will have an unlocked multipliers and higher TDPs/clockspeeds.",
    "</p>  <p> In regards to performance, AMD is touting an average (geomean) IPC increase in desktop workloads for Zen 5 of 16%.",
    "And with the new desktop Ryzen chips&apos; turbo clockspeeds remaining largely identical to their Ryzen 7000 predecessors, this should translate into similar performance expectations for the new chips.",
    "</p>  <p> The AMD Ryzen 9000 series will also launch on the AM5 socket, which debuted with AMD&apos;s Ryzen 7000 series and marks AMD&apos;s commitment to socket/platform longevity.",
    "Along with the Ryzen 9000 series will come a pair of new high-performance chipsets: the X870E (Extreme) and the regular X870 chipsets.",
    "The fundamental features that vendors will integrate into their specific motherboards remain tight-lipped.",
    "Still, we do know that USB 4.0 ports are standard on the X870E/X870 boards, along with PCIe 5.0 for both PCIe graphics and NVMe storage, with higher AMD EXPO memory profile support expected than previous generations.",

    "Furthermore, AMD&apos;s mobile counterpart offering, the Ryzen AI 300 series (Strix Point) has been confirmed for 4nm, and we&apos;ve yet to see an AMD desktop CPU die produced on a more advanced node than its mobile counterpart.",

    "These start with an improved branch predictor, which is designed to offer better accuracy, efficiency, and reduced overall latency of instruction cycles.",
    "The Zen 5 architecture also boasts higher throughput with wider pipelines and SIMDs, allowing for faster data processing and equating to better overall performance in benchmarks such as CineBench and Blender and workloads leveraging the AVX-512 instruction set.",
    "</p>  <p> Additionally, Zen 5 introduces a deeper out-of-order instruction window size across its design, enabling more parallelism and better handling of multiple instructions within the pipeline simultaneously.",

    "L2 to L1 memory bandwidth is one such example, giving the cache hierarchy a big bandwidth boost that should allow for faster data transfers within the individual CPU cores.",
    "AMD also claims better AI performance in inferencing and AVX-512 workloads.",
    "Notably, AMD&apos;s AVX-512 support on Zen 4 was executed using a 256-bit SIMD over 2 cycles, so this may be a sign that AMD has expanded their AVX-512 SIMDs to a full 512-bits wide in the Zen 5 architecture.",

    "It should be noted, however, that the top result in this benchmark collection is in the GeekBench 5.3 AES XTS benchmark, which leverages the VAES512 and VAES256 extensions of the AVX-512 instruction set.",
    "So AMD&apos;s AVX-512 SIMD changes greatly impact that benchmark in particular (though not exclusively).",

    "As with previous generations of Ryzen processors, there&apos;s a large central I/O die (IOD), through which all I/O and memory operations are routed.",
    "As for the CCDs, each die once again contains 8 CPU cores, with AMD equipping Ryzen chips with either 1 or 2 CCDs depending on the SKU.",
    "The new Zen 5 CCDs are being fabbed on one of TSMC&apos;s 4nm processes (AMD hasn&apos;t confirmed which flavor), which is a modest shrink from the N5 process used for Zen 4 CCDs.",
    "</p>  <p> Meanwhile, although AMD hasn&apos;t confirmed that they&apos;re reusing the Ryzen 7000 series IOD here, all signs currently point to the Ryzen 9000 IOD being similar or identical to it.",
    "In particular, it is fabbed on the same TSMC N6 process, with the same 2 RDNA graphics CUs, and it offers the exact same off-chip I/O capabilities (though the latter is admittedly also dictated by the AM5 socket).",
    "</p>  <p> AMD&apos;s Ryzen 9000 chips will also feature similar memory support as their predecessors, with AMD sticking to DDR5.",
    "However, AMD does note that the incoming X870E and X870 motherboard chipsets will allow for faster EXPO memory profiles than seen on Zen 4.",
    "As it stands, AMD hasn&apos;t disclosed the JEDEC memory specification of the four Ryzen 9000 SKUs that it announced today.",
