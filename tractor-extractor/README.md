## 📜🚜  Tractor the Text Extractor 📜🚜

* URL to Main Content & Cite - extract main article text with formatted basic markup, using Postlight Parser which improves the Readability algorithm with  site-specific selectors
* Cite - select html tag classes and metadata for author, date, source, and title.
* Youtube to Transcript - via official API and youtubetranscript.com
* PDF to HTML Markup - with text cleaning, joining into paragraphs, infering headings by text height, moving footnotes to end
* Top Sentences and Keyphrases -  Weights sentences using TextRank noun keyphrase frequency  to find which sentences centralize and tie together keyphrase concepts refered to most by other sentences.
